This program was made by Gabriel F. Habermann, it was the firsta Numerical
Calculus project, the goal of the project was create the algorithm of the
Bissection method.

Talking about the language that I used, I picked Python because I consider
a very intuitive language, it's simple to understand the syntax, and in the
same time, it's very powerful.
